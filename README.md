# accountability-sysdig-kafka

Code for an accountability solution based on Sysdig, Librdkafka producer, Apache Kafka and MongoDB.
Three subfolders are included to contain the adapted Sysdig Lua scripts (chisels) regarding the evaluated frameworks: ROS, ROS2 and contenedorized ROS.

Minimal configuration is required in Lua scripts when being used as an accountability system for frameworks of applications different from the ones chosen.
